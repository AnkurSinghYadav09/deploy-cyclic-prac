***deployment***

i am giving you 5 minutes to buiold something :--

we will be back on 9:00pm

**backend-platforms**
1]heroku--paid
2]render--free but slow
3]Railway--- slow
4]***cyclic--- this fast and paid.. but provide one deployment for free.


Points to follow:--

1] ensure that in package.json you add the "start" script.
2] have its valueas "start":"node index.js".
          - dont have "server" or anything else instead of start
          - dont have nodemon insetead of node.
          - dont have server.js or xyz.js instead of index.js file name

3] keep your PORT number in the variable preferably from .env as PORT instead of hardcoding. 
4] you can keep all your secret things inside in the .env file {jsonwebtoken secretToken, mongodb url etc}
